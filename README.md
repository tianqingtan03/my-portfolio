## About Me

Hello! I am Tian Qing, a passionate young investor and this is the place where I store my personal work. Since 2021 during my high school, I have already actively engaged in different segments of the financial world — starting from the Malaysian Stock Market (2021–2023), followed by the Gold Market (2024), and more recently, the US Stock Market (2025). My journey began with Technical Analysis, but over time, I transitioned toward Fundamental Analysis, focusing on industry and equity research, and eventually to Quantitative Analysis, where I discovered my enthusiasm for working with large datasets and numerical insights. 

I would describe myself as an analytical and independent thinker who enjoys solving complex problems through logic and structured reasoning. Analytical thinking is undoubtedly my greatest strength.
